This is the version we are using

```{r}

version

```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
These are my installed and loaded packages: 

```{r}

library("sf")
library("raster")
library("spData")

```

This is basic arithmetic:

```{r}

4+1

```

This is pulling from the "world" data from spData and using the "plot"" feature from sf
```{r}

plot(world)

```

This uses the "summary" function from world. 
```{r}
summary(world["lifeExp"])

```
