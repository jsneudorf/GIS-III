This document will analyze the nz dataset with basic information about New Zealand.


First, Summary Statistics on the variables included in the dataset:
```{r nz}
summary(nz)
```




To go deeper, below is a histogram of median income per region. It is clear that the nationwide median is likely between 26000 and 28000. 

```{r , echo=FALSE}
hist(nz$Median_income)
```


This conclusion is then mapped, showing the regional disparities in income. 
```{r plot, Echo = FALSE}
plot(nz["Median_income"])
```
